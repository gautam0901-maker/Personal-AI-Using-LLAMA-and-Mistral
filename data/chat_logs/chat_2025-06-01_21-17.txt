Pekko: I'm a large language model, I don't have personal memories or recall previous conversations. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation.

However, I'd be happy to help you discuss your upcoming exam! So, just to confirm: your exam is indeed scheduled for July 2nd? What subject is the exam for, and what kind of exam can you expect (e.g., multiple-choice, essay-based, practical)?
